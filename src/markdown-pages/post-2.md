## A list of questions that I have had during Front End interviews

Last year, after six years of work at Groupon, I decided to move on and change jobs. I spent a lot of time getting ready for technical interviews. The last time I had a job interview was back 2013, in a different country and a different level of experience. In this post I want to share what kind of questions I saw during the process.

I interviewed in 18 places during 4 months. I gained experience along the way and honestly, I have to say that the best way to get ready for interviewing is just schedule phone calls do real practice. Even though I failed a lot of technical phone screens, the amount of experience I gained during the process makes everything worth it. 

### Technical Interview questions

Some of the questions I saw during the process were:

1. Do an implementation of Promise functionality (Promise API).
2. Implement a Model (Backbone like / Ember like) from scratch.
3. Implement a throttle function.
4. Implement the JSON.parse() function.
5. Implement a BST data structure.
6. Get the median of two sorted arrays.
7. Implement a string compression algorithm.
8. Debug a ToDo list implementation.
9. Implement a Publisher class.
10. Create an Event class.
11. Create a text validation function. Given a long string of words it will return true or false wether the content is safe or not when comparing against an array of words (blacklist).
12. Filter words based on an array of objects.
13. Implement a Deck class with shuffle and deal hand methods.
14. Implement a search function for an HTML text input considering thousands of possible results (Trie).


### Behavioral questions

1. Why are you interviewing with us.
2. How would you approach a team conflict situation.
3. If you have two important tasks to finish, how would you prioritize them and why.

### System design questions

1. Design a parking lot system.
2. Design a user interaction event tracker.
3. Design an online chat application.
4. Describe some system you've designed before.
